### Crop Recommendation System
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals choose the best crops to cultivate based on various environmental and soil parameters. The system takes inputs like soil type, pH level, rainfall, and more to suggest the most suitable crop for optimal yield.

## Features
Machine Learning Predictions: Provides crop recommendations based on input features.
Flask Backend: The application uses a Flask web server for serving the machine learning model.
Web Integration: The system can be integrated with websites and accessed via a simple web interface.
Real-time Recommendations: The system provides recommendations instantly after receiving inputs.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
A pre-trained machine learning model (model.pkl)


## Steps to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/crop-recommendation.git
cd crop-recommendation


## Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

## Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Flask application:
python app.py

## Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the Crop Recommendation System.

## Usage
Enter the environmental and soil parameters (such as nitrogen, potassium, pH, rainfall, etc.).
Click the "Recommend Crop" button.
The system will display the most suitable crop to grow based on the input data.

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using a dataset containing various environmental parameters and their corresponding suitable crops. You can retrain the model using the data/crop_data.csv file if desired.

## Deployment
To deploy the Crop Recommendation System on a hosting service (e.g., Render, Heroku):

Upload the files, including app.py, index.html, and model.pkl.
Ensure that the hosting service supports Python and Flask.
Configure the necessary environment variables and settings for deployment.
